			<h1>  About Me</h1>
			<p> <img src="waterfloppa.jpg" alt="A picture of me"/>Hi there, my name is Jamal Haruna and I am a full time Computer Science student at 
			Queen Mary's University of London. I have been in love with technology for as long as I can remember, but my deep dive into computer science
			began at the age of 12 with my introduction to Scratch. Ever since then I have been fascinated by application development and continuously strived
			to learn new languages and more about programming. I love the process of breaking a problem down and analysing their logical components.
			Seeing a functional piece of code is immensely satisfying, almost like a jigsaw puzzle where each piece fits together perfectly.</p>
